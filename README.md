# stbi_image_bmp-jpg-png
Problem: undefined reference to 'stbi_image_bmp' in CodeBlocks

Using stb_image and stb_image_write for load and save images.
The main problem is in save image after changing colors to gray.
Trying use function stbi_write_bmp (jpg or png) and taking problem from CodBlocks level.
Tried using solution for my project in video YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OyQoPCp46o

Perhabs I haven't not enough configuration my CodeBlocks for load and save images in project.
I had to put all path (C:\Users\...\project-stbi-images\image.bmp) in code, but many coders use just "image.bmp" for load and save file (image).

I dont know how to solve this problem.
